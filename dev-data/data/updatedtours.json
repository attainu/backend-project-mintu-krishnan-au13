It presents a fantasy-like landscape which looks like it’s been plucked out of a fairy tale, alien-like hills and boulders that seem as if they’ve been transported from another planet. The humans who once lived here used the area’s soft stone to create underground shelters, leaving all kinds of weird architectural wonders in their wake. The lunar landscape is stunning on its own, but the countless hot-air balloons that fill up the sky with shades of red, yellow, orange and cream simply take its beauty to the next level. The Goreme Open Air Museum and its rock-cut churches and the subterranean wonders of Kaymakli are among the best things to see in Cappadocia.",

This area is notably beautiful with arid mountains and picture-perfect Buddhist gompas and monasteries. It is a favoured destination, especially among adventurers and mountain-lovers. The rough climatic conditions and inhospitable terrain only add to the charm of this place. The peaceful Shanti Stupa, surreal Pangong Lake, highest cold-desert called Nubra Valley, Khardung-La Mountain Pass and the awe-inspiring Magnetic Hill are just a few places in this land of dreams. With gushing streams, snow peaks, mountain passes and many stunning trekking trails, Leh is a place that is all too easy to fall in love with!",

      "description": "Kerala’s slogan of “God’s own country” is hard to deny, given the overflow of natural beauty in this South Indian state. The exotic hill stations, amazing backwaters and beautiful beaches make this state a tourist heaven. Ecotourism development and the general beauty of the place has made the state into one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. Kerala is exotic and enchanting in its beauty. The spice- and tea-covered slopes of Western Ghats make Munnar a splendid hill town. Alleppey is known for its languid network of backwaters. The famous beaches in the state are Kovalam and Varkala beaches. An overnight stay in a lazy houseboat in the brackish waters of Alleppey is a must when you are in Kerala. The state also offers many yoga and spa centres. Periyar Tiger Reserve is also worth mentioning. Visit Kerala",
